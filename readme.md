# System Control Lab - SS20 - RWTH

A reposetory for the solutions of  "Regelungstechnisches Labor". 
In this course diverse control system theoris have been used to regulate diverse systems.

## Subjects of the sessions:

* Session 1 & 2: Introduction to Simulink and Matlab
* Session 3: 
Control of a mechanical spring mass damper system System by using continues controllers (PID)
    * Control Tuning using Root Locus
    * Introduction to CAN
* Session 4 & 5: 
Control of a MIMO-Tank System.
    * Modeling the system in Simulink
    * Using only one pump and 2 valvs to control the water level in 3 connected tanks
    * Implementing delys to simulate the pump and the pipes fluid mechanical properties
* Session 6 & 7: 
Control of an Inverted pendulum.
    * Linearizing the nonlinear model on the top unstable position.
    * Using a PT1 with delay to simplize the pendelum model
    * Control the model via LQR, Sliding Mode and pole assignment
